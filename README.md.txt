# This project is pretty dead.

You probably shouldn't be looking at much of the code here as most of it is ripped out of other projects and is an old project I tried to play around with for a bit. For now, the website this used on doesn't exist anymore, and I'll likely take down this repo and replace it later with an updated example of a live chat system using Node.js and socket.io
